# Ticketmaster Price Watcher

**tm-price-watcher** sends you SMS, email, and/or browser push notifications when ticket prices for an event on Ticketmaster meet your criteria.

Ticketmaster doesn't have a feature that does this. Refreshing my browser every 5 minutes while trying to get cheap Bucs tickets annoyed me, so I decided to build this.

I'm building the backend to start. I'll probably build a frontend. I won't be able to scale this because Ticketmaster's public API limits me to 5000 requests per month.

StubHub has a price watching feature, but it sucks because it only notifies you once per day. You'd likely miss any really good deals.

If I have enough fun writing this, I might write a ticket-sniping bot that circumvents the restrictions of Ticketmaster's public API.
